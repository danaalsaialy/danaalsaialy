## Hi and welcome 🧬

I'm [Dana](danaalsaialy.com), a social scientist based in Riyadh.
I use **R** to conduct research, create reproducible files, and build data visualisations, dashboards, and apps—mostly in the public health space.

*Currently learning and growing on GitHub, so expect experimentation and ongoing projects!*

**Fun facts:**
- I dislike seafood but love sushi
- An aspiring Q-Grader (coffee sommelier)
- Interested in music, minecraft, and motorsports
